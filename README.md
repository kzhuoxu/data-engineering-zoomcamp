# Data Engineering Zoomcamp - Personal Learning Journey

This repository contains my personal notes, exercises, and projects as I work through the Data Engineering Zoomcamp by [DataTalksClub](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp).

## About This Repository

This is my personal fork of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp where I track my progress, store my notes, and document my learning journey. I've modified some aspects of the original curriculum to fit my learning style and interests, including replacing Kestra with Airflow in Module 2.

## Course Structure

The 9-week bootcamp covers:

- **Week 1**: Docker, PostgreSQL, Terraform, and Google Cloud Platform
- **Week 2**: Workflow orchestration with Airflow 
- **Week 3**: Data warehousing with BigQuery and dbt
- **Week 4**: Analytics and dashboarding with Metabase
- **Week 5**: Batch processing with Apache Spark
- **Week 6**: Streaming with Kafka and Kafka Streams
- **Weeks 7-9**: Final project implementation

## My Notes

I'll be adding detailed notes for each module as I progress through the course. These notes include:
- Key concepts and terminology
- Command references and code snippets
- Common pitfalls and their solutions
- Personal insights and connections between topics

## Projects & Homework

This repository also contains my solutions to weekly homework assignments and the final project. Each solution includes explanations of my approach and what I learned.
